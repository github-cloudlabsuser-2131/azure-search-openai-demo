# Backend Application Documentation

Welcome to the backend application documentation. This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, setting up, and contributing to the backend of this project. It is designed to help developers quickly get started and maintain consistency across environments.

## Overview

The backend application is the core of the project, responsible for handling business logic, database interactions, and exposing APIs for the frontend or other services. It is built using modern Python frameworks and libraries to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Framework**: Built with Quart for high-performance asynchronous operations.
- **Cloud Integration**: Seamless integration with Azure services for storage, identity, and AI capabilities.
- **Modular Design**: Organized directory structure for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Testing Support**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

## Getting Started

This document is structured to guide you through the setup, configuration, and usage of the backend application. Follow the instructions step-by-step to ensure a smooth development experience.

- **Setup Instructions**: Learn how to set up your development environment.
- **Running the Application**: Instructions to start the backend server.
- **Testing**: Guidelines for running and writing tests.
- **Configuration**: Details on modifying application settings.
- **Contributing**: Steps to contribute to the project.

For more details, refer to the sections below. Backend Application

This directory contains the backend application for the project. The backend is responsible for handling business logic, database interactions, and providing APIs for the frontend or other services.

## Directory Structure

```
app/backend/
├── src/                # Source code for the backend application
├── tests/              # Unit and integration tests
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
└── README.md           # Documentation for the backend
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (Python package manager)

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd app/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Linux/MacOS:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the backend application, run:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Testing

Run the tests using:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory. Update these files to modify application settings.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the backend application, please follow the guidelines in the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## License

This project is licensed under the terms of the [LICENSE](../../LICENSE) file.

# Backend Dependencies

The `requirements.txt` file in the `app/backend/` directory lists the Python dependencies required for the backend application. These dependencies are installed in the Python virtual environment to ensure the backend runs correctly.

## File Location

- Path: `app/backend/requirements.txt`

## Purpose

This file is used to manage the backend's Python dependencies. It ensures that all required libraries and their specific versions are installed consistently across different environments.

## Example Dependencies

The file typically includes dependencies such as:

- **Quart**: An asynchronous Python web framework used for building the backend.
- **Azure SDKs**: Libraries for interacting with Azure services like Storage, Identity, and AI.
- **aiohttp**: An asynchronous HTTP client/server framework.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP server for running the backend in production.

## Installation Instructions

To install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `app/backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd app/backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Updating Dependencies

To update the dependencies, modify the `requirements.txt` file and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After updating, ensure the application works as expected and commit the changes to version control.

## Notes

- This file is critical for maintaining consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- Use tools like `pip freeze` to generate or update the `requirements.txt` file based on the current environment.
